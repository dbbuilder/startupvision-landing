# StartupVision Blog Strategy

> Content plan for establishing StartupVision as a thought leader in startup technology partnerships

---

## Brand Voice Guidelines

**Tone:** Professional, authoritative, yet approachable
**Formality:** Semi-formal (consulting firm meets startup energy)
**Style:** Clear, direct, actionable. No fluff. Every paragraph earns its place.

### Writing Principles
- Lead with insights, not sales pitches
- Use specific numbers and examples over vague claims
- Acknowledge complexity—don't oversimplify
- End with actionable next steps
- Write for founders and technical leaders

### Vocabulary
- "Technology partnership" not "outsourcing"
- "Senior engineers" not "developers"
- "AI-augmented" not "AI-powered" (humans lead, AI amplifies)
- "Compliance-first" not "compliance-ready"

### Avoid
- Buzzwords without substance
- Hyperbolic claims
- Generic startup advice
- Condescending explanations
