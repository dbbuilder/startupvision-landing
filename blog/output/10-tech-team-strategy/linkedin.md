"Should I hire full-time or use an agency?"

Wrong question.

The answer changes with your stage, product, and capabilities.

THE FOUR MODELS:

1. FULL-TIME
✓ Deep context, cultural alignment, long-term retention
✗ Slow to scale, full cost, recruiting required

2. FRACTIONAL (part-time senior leaders)
✓ Senior experience immediately, flexible, lower cost
✗ Divided attention, not available constantly

3. AGENCY/PARTNER
✓ Fast ramp, scalable, no recruiting burden
✗ Less context, knowledge leaves, quality varies

4. HYBRID
✓ Optimizes each function, flexibility + stability
✗ Coordination complexity, more relationships

STAGE-APPROPRIATE STRUCTURE:

PRE-SEED: Founder-led + agency for prototype
→ You're validating. Speed > optimization.

SEED: Small full-time core (2-4) + fractional leadership
→ You have PMF signals. Need commitment + flexibility.

SERIES A: Larger team (8-15) + fractional specialists
→ Scaling. Dedicated teams + specialized expertise.

SERIES B+: Full-time default + agency for overflow
→ Culture and execution matter. Long-term knowledge matters.

THE DECISION FACTORS:
→ Predictability of work
→ Specialization required
→ Your hiring capability
→ Capital efficiency needs

COMMON MISTAKES:
• Hiring full-time before PMF
• Never building full-time ownership
• Choosing agencies on price alone
• Ignoring the transition between models

There's no universally right structure—only right for YOUR stage, product, and capabilities.

Match your structure to your reality. Adjust as reality changes.
