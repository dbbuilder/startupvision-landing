Every week, another startup claims they're building software "10x faster with AI."

Every month, we see the aftermath: unmaintainable codebases, security vulnerabilities, and products that demo great but fail in production.

After building 50+ AI-driven SaaS products and 180+ MVPs, here's what we've learned:

The problem isn't AI. It's who's making the decisions.

AI coding assistants are remarkable at:
→ Generating boilerplate
→ Implementing well-defined functions
→ Writing initial test cases
→ Handling repetitive patterns

But AI can't:
→ Understand your business context
→ Make architectural decisions that compound over years
→ Catch subtle bugs that only experience recognizes
→ Navigate the trade-offs that define good software

Our approach: AI-augmented development.

Human-led teams using AI as a force multiplier—not a replacement.

Senior engineers (20+ years average experience) make every architectural decision. AI accelerates the implementation. Human review catches the 20% of suggestions that look correct but aren't.

That 20% is the difference between a product that works and one that works in production.

The speed advantage is real—but it comes from fewer rewrites, less debugging, and no compliance retrofits. Not from skipping the thinking.

If you're building a quick prototype, AI-first tools might be perfect.

If you're building something that needs to scale, meet compliance requirements, and support a real business—you need human judgment directing the AI.

What's your experience with AI in development? Curious what's working for others.
