Your codebase is an asset. It's also a liability.

The difference between code that accelerates your business and code that drags it down often comes from whether someone experienced has looked at it critically.

The hidden costs of skipping code review:

1. DEVELOPER VELOCITY DECAY
Features that should take a week start taking a month. By the time you notice, you've lost months of cumulative productivity.

2. THE REWRITE TAX
Eventually, the codebase becomes untenable. Every month spent rewriting is a month not spent on growth.

3. SECURITY INCIDENTS
Vulnerabilities compound. That insecure auth flow from month one is still there in month twelve—with twelve months of user data exposed.

4. SCALING SURPRISES
The query that worked at 100 users becomes a bottleneck at 10,000. Problems discovered in production are expensive. Problems discovered in review are cheap.

When code review makes sense:
→ Before raising (investors will diligence)
→ Before scaling
→ When inheriting code
→ When development feels slower than it should
→ Annually, even for well-run teams

What expert review provides:
• Architecture assessment
• Security analysis
• Performance evaluation
• Technical debt inventory
• Actionable remediation priorities

The investment: 1-2 weeks of senior engineer time
The return: Avoided rewrites, prevented incidents, accelerated development

If your codebase is important to your business, external review isn't an expense—it's risk management.
