"Just ship it."

Great advice. But after building 180+ MVPs, we've seen what separates the ones that become companies from the ones that become lessons.

It's not shipping speed.

5 things that actually determine MVP success:

1. THE PROBLEM IS REAL (AND PEOPLE WILL PAY)

Talk to 20+ potential customers. Not friends. Ask what they're paying now to solve this. Propose your solution at a price. Enthusiasm is interesting. Deposits are convincing.

2. THE SCOPE IS RUTHLESSLY LIMITED

Every feature delays learning. Write down the ONE thing you need to learn. Build only what's required to learn it. Everything else is v2.

3. THE TECHNICAL FOUNDATION ALLOWS ITERATION

You'll pivot. Architecture that allows change beats architecture built for scale you don't have. But security isn't optional—data breaches don't wait for your Series A.

4. THERE'S A CLEAR PATH TO FEEDBACK

Analytics that reveal actual usage. Channels for user feedback. Metrics tied to your hypothesis. A plan for responding to what you learn.

5. THE TEAM CAN EXECUTE BEYOND LAUNCH

Launch is the starting line. Can you monitor issues? Ship updates quickly? Resist feature creep when it gets tempting?

What doesn't determine success:
→ Technology sophistication
→ Visual polish
→ Feature count
→ Time spent building

The goal isn't months of work. It's validated learning.
