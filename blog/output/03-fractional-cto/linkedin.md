You started without a CTO. Many successful companies do.

But there's a moment when the technical decisions you're avoiding start to compound. Here are the signals:

1. Technical decisions keep getting deferred to "later"
2. Engineering conversations confuse you
3. You're hiring engineers without technical evaluation
4. Enterprise customers are asking questions you can't answer
5. Investors are concerned about technical risk

If you're seeing these, you need technical leadership.

But a full-time CTO costs $200-400K, takes 6 months to find, and might not be the right fit.

A fractional CTO gives you:

→ Experience immediately (no search, no onboarding)
→ Flexibility (10 hours/week to start, scale as needed)
→ Broader perspective (patterns from multiple companies)
→ Cost efficiency (senior leadership at a fraction of full-time)
→ A bridge while you search for full-time

What does a fractional CTO actually do?

Not writing code.

They handle:
- Technical strategy and architecture decisions
- Team structure and hiring
- Vendor and technology evaluation
- Risk identification
- Credibility in board meetings and enterprise sales

The right time for fractional: you need technical leadership but aren't ready for a full-time hire.

The right time for full-time: 15+ engineers, continuous complex decisions, validated need.
