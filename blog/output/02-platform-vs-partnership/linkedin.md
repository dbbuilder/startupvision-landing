"Should we use a platform or hire a team?"

Every founder asks this. And the answer shapes your timeline, costs, and product quality.

After working with hundreds of founders, here's the framework we use:

Choose PLATFORM when:
→ You have technical capability in-house
→ You're validating an idea (not building production)
→ Budget is tighter than time
→ The product is relatively straightforward
→ You want hands-on control

Choose PARTNERSHIP when:
→ You're a non-technical founder
→ Speed is critical
→ The product is technically complex
→ You're building for enterprise customers
→ Your time creates more value elsewhere

The mistake I see most often:

Founders choose platform to save money, then spend 10x fixing quality issues before they can scale.

The second most common:

Founders hire expensive teams before they know what to build.

The reality is most companies evolve through both:

Early stage → Platform for prototyping
Growth stage → Partnership for production
Scale stage → Hybrid team

The key question isn't "which is better?" It's "which fits your situation right now?"

Quick test: Can you or your team evaluate code quality? If not, who will?
