Building health tech? You're building on HIPAA ground.

Here's what most founders don't realize:

Building HIPAA-compliant from day one adds ~15-20% to development time.

Retrofitting later costs 3-5x that.

DOES HIPAA APPLY TO YOU?

If you handle Protected Health Information (PHI) for hospitals, clinics, insurers, or any covered entity—yes.

PHI = any data that can identify an individual AND relates to their health.

THE THREE RULES:

1. Privacy Rule: How PHI is used and disclosed
2. Security Rule: How to protect electronic PHI
3. Breach Notification Rule: What happens if PHI is exposed

THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
→ Access control (MFA, role-based access)
→ Audit controls (log everything)
→ Encryption (at rest AND in transit)
→ Transmission security (TLS 1.2+)

THE BAA REALITY:

Every vendor that handles PHI needs a Business Associate Agreement with you.

Cloud provider? BAA.
Email service? BAA.
Analytics? BAA.

No BAA = HIPAA violation.

COMPLIANCE-FIRST APPROACH:
1. Choose HIPAA-eligible infrastructure
2. Sign BAAs before using vendors
3. Enable encryption by default
4. Design for audit logging
5. Document everything

THE RETROFIT NIGHTMARE:
• PHI scattered across systems
• No audit logging (re-architecture required)
• Vendors without BAAs (migration required)
• 3-6 months engineering time
• Delayed sales while fixing

HIPAA isn't the enemy—uncertainty about HIPAA is.

Build for it from day one. Your future self will thank you.
