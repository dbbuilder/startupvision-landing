Your tech stack will outlive your initial assumptions.

Choose poorly → spend your Series A rewriting
Choose wisely → barely think about it

After 50+ products built, here's the principle:

BORING IS USUALLY RIGHT.

Every year brings exciting new frameworks. Most won't exist in five years. The ones that will are boring now—proven, stable, well-documented.

The 2026 boring stack that works:

FRONTEND: React or Next.js
→ Mature, well-documented, easy to hire for

BACKEND: Node.js, Python, or Go
→ Node for JS teams and real-time
→ Python for data/ML integration
→ Go for high-performance requirements

DATABASE: PostgreSQL
→ Reliable, flexible, free
→ Handles scale you won't reach for years

AUTH: Don't build it yourself
→ Use Auth0, Clerk, or Supabase Auth

PAYMENTS: Stripe
→ Just use Stripe

INFRASTRUCTURE: AWS, GCP, or Vercel
→ Pick based on team familiarity

Other decisions that matter more:

• Start with a monolith (microservices add complexity you don't need yet)
• Plan data residency early (expensive to fix later)
• Don't over-engineer state management

What NOT to optimize for:
→ Hypothetical scale
→ Resume appeal
→ Perfection

Your tech stack is a tool, not a destination.

The best stack is the one that gets out of your way while you ship.
