You're closing an enterprise deal. Procurement sends the security questionnaire.

"Please provide your SOC 2 Type II report."

You don't have one. Now what?

Here's the no-BS breakdown:

WHAT IT IS:
Security audit across 5 areas: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, Privacy.

Type I = point-in-time snapshot
Type II = 6-12 months of maintained controls (what enterprises want)

DO YOU NEED IT?
Yes if:
→ Selling to Fortune 500 or regulated industries
→ Handling sensitive data
→ Your customers' compliance depends on yours

Not yet if:
→ SMB customers who don't require it
→ Pre-product-market fit
→ Your customers haven't asked

WHAT IT COSTS:
• Audit: $30-75K (Type II)
• Compliance platform: $15-40K/year
• Infrastructure: $5-20K/year
• Personnel time: 25-50% of someone for months

First-year total: $60-150K

TIMELINE:
12-18 months for first Type II if starting from scratch.

THE STARTUP APPROACH:
1. Build compliance in from day one (way cheaper than retrofitting)
2. Use a platform (Vanta, Drata, Secureframe)
3. Limit scope strategically
4. Consider Type I first while working toward Type II

The biggest mistake: waiting until you lose a deal. SOC 2 takes 12+ months. Start before you need it.

Enterprise customers in your future? SOC 2 should be in your roadmap.

Anyone have tips from their SOC 2 journey?
